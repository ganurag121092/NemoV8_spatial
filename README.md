Spatial DB Map Viewer Project
-----------------------------

These are the SDO_GEOMETRY querires to be run against Oracle DB. The specific version of Oracle used here is Oracle 11g Express Edition.

In order to visualize the ouptput of these queries, we need an Oracle MapViewer. I have used Oracle Mapviewer 11 ps3 version for accomplishing this project.
